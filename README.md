# RNA-Folding-Prediction
Takes a string of RNA base molecules (simulating and RNA strand) and predicts the secondary structure in a pretty GUI

4 creators: [Caleigh](https://github.com/lepagec), Colin, [Jared](https://github.com/jared-march), and [Raymond](https://github.com/ShiroYasha97).

To download the executable, navigate to the [Release](/Release) folder and download [RNA-Folding.exe](/Release/RNA-Folding.exe).

The program takes a string of RNA base molecules: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Uracil (U). They can be typed in or uploaded from a .txt file.

There are some [examples](/Release/Examples) in /Release as well, these can be uploaded into the program to produce a folded RNA strand.
